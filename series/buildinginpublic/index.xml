      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;week-1-learnings&#34;&gt;Week 1 Learnings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lots of busy work and not much of a plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a bunch of work done, and if I’m not being harsh on myself, I can say that I did achieve some goals. But over the weekend I had a deep sense of dissatisfaction with the way things are. Lots of busy work, with a sense of progress—feel good at the end of the day—but no real progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p><em>Lots of busy work and not much of a plan</em></p>
<p>I got a bunch of work done, and if I’m not being harsh on myself, I can say that I did achieve some goals. But over the weekend I had a deep sense of dissatisfaction with the way things are. Lots of busy work, with a sense of progress—feel good at the end of the day—but no real progress.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>Found a co-working space — IndiQube Orion, HSR Layout. Loved working there last Friday.</li>
<li>Iterations on the website: creating some content, and a lot of busy work (SEO tweaks, etc.).</li>
<li>Reachouts: I reached out to different people for feedback and potential collaborations.</li>
<li>On the personal front: hit the gym twice; some accounts and health stuff.</li>
</ol>
<p>The mistakes I made and what I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using too much AI; I slipped into busy work, didn’t review much of the output, and just kept prompting/vibing.</li>
</ul>
<p>This week, two things I will do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Focus on 2–3 tasks a day, and do them well.</li>
<li>Use AI as little as possible.</li>
</ol>

      <title>#BuildingInPublic Week 2: Refining the Approach</title>
      <link>https://varun-ml.github.io/posts/building-in-public/week-02-learnings/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;week-2-learnings&#34;&gt;Week 2 Learnings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using a hammer to swat a fly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week was a mixed bag. Spent a tremendous amount of time on work, really impressed with my own stamina and focus.
Touched a lot of things, from the website minor revamps (closing the blogs), youtube launch, even started with modelling the stock swings in python, and started some ads campaigns.
The issue is perhaps similar to last week, I am using a sledgehammer to swat a fly. Lot of busy work. AI is a great tool, but I am using it too much. I need to be more deliberate in my use of it. For instance, I got the full modelling done by CODEX, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand the code fully, now I am deliberately going through it line by line to understand it. And even though slow I am much more happy that I am learning and making progress.
There is a fine balance between using AI to accelerate work, and using it as a crutch. I need to be careful of that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p><em>Using a hammer to swat a fly</em></p>
<p>This week was a mixed bag. Spent a tremendous amount of time on work, really impressed with my own stamina and focus.
Touched a lot of things, from the website minor revamps (closing the blogs), youtube launch, even started with modelling the stock swings in python, and started some ads campaigns.
The issue is perhaps similar to last week, I am using a sledgehammer to swat a fly. Lot of busy work. AI is a great tool, but I am using it too much. I need to be more deliberate in my use of it. For instance, I got the full modelling done by CODEX, but I didn&rsquo;t understand the code fully, now I am deliberately going through it line by line to understand it. And even though slow I am much more happy that I am learning and making progress.
There is a fine balance between using AI to accelerate work, and using it as a crutch. I need to be careful of that.</p>
<p>But, I am happy that I am making progress, it&rsquo;s not like a perfect straight line, but so is any machine learning curve, you go up and down, but the overall trend is up. Also, thankful to have a great community around me, friends and family who are super supportive and strangers who are willing to help. Struck up so many conversations this week, learning a lot about the tools, about trading. Also, usually feel lot more relaxed and calm, not stressed about things and even when stressed I am able to manage it better.</p>
<p>This week I will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be more deliberate in my use of AI, use it as a tool, not a crutch.</li>
<li>Focus on 2-3 tasks a day, and do them well.</li>
<li>Keep focus on reading, and modelling the stock swings, start on the core MVP features.</li>
<li>Keep up the physical fitness, hit the gym at least 3 times a week.</li>
</ol>

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my #BuildingInPublic series where I document the journey of building &lt;a href=&#34;https://stockomj.ai&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;stockoMJ.ai&lt;/a&gt; and &amp;ldquo;WITY&amp;rdquo; - an AI trading assistant designed to help traders make disciplined, data-driven decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each week, I&amp;rsquo;ll share progress updates, technical learnings, challenges, and reflections as I build this AI-powered fintech product. Follow along for insights on generative AI, market analysis, and building in the finance space.&lt;/p&gt;
