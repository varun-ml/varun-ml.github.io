[{"content":"What are Denoising Diffusion Models? Denoising Diffusion Models, commonly referred to as \u0026ldquo;Diffusion models\u0026rdquo;, are a class of generative models based on the Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) architecture. These models are called likelihood-based models because they assign a high likelihood to the observed data samples. In contrast to other generative models, such as GANs, which learn the sampling process of a complex distribution and are trained adversarially.\nVAE\u0026rsquo;s Let\u0026rsquo;s take a detour and understand VAEs, as it will help with some intuition. VAEs are composed of two processes: an encoder ($q$) (also referred to as the inference model), which generates a latent representation ($z$) of the input data ($x_0$), and a decoder ($p$) (also referred to as the generator), which generates the input data ($\\hat x_0$) using the latent representation ($z$) as input. The encoder and decoder are trained together using a variational objective, often referred to as the ELBO.\nFigure 1: An architecture for a Variational Auto Encoder. (Image source: VAE tutorial, Kingma et.al; 2019)\nFigure 2: Graphical representation of a Variational Auto Encoder. The $p$ function is the decoder and the $q$ function is the encoder. (Image source: Calvin Luo; 2022)\nFigures 1 \u0026amp; 2 give a simplistic representation of a VAE model.\nDenoising Diffusion Models Analogous to VAEs, Denoising Diffusion models also consist of two processes: Diffusion, which is analogous to the VAE encoder, and Denoising, which is analogous to the VAE decoder.\nDiffusion - The diffusion process repeatedly samples random noise and corrupts our input data by adding the noise. In contrast to the VAE encoder, we typically do not learn this process. At step $T$, the data would be so corrupted that its just noise. Figure 3: Illustration of the Diffusion Process. Image of \u0026lsquo;Z\u0026rsquo; char is corrupted step by step.\nDenoising - The denoising is done by a learned model that takes completely noisy data and tries to generate the input data by repeatedly (over $t$ steps: $1$ to $T$) removing noise from the noisy data. Figure 4: Illustration of the Denoising Process. Image of \u0026lsquo;Z\u0026rsquo; character is generated step by step.\nDiffusion models are able to generate images from pure noise.\nHumans paint, they are able to generate images in a stepwise manner by painting on a blank canvas. Diffusion models are similar, they generate images in a stepwise manner by denoising a noisy canvas.\nIntroduction to this series I have spent too much time understanding diffusion models, which started with some wild posts I saw on Twitter.\nIntroducing Imagen, a new text-to-image synthesis model that can generate high-fidelity, photorealistic images from a deep level of language understanding.

(Image source: Imagen Web Link)\nMy curiosity led to experiments, which enriched my ML skill-set. In this series, I will try to demystify some of the magic behind diffusion models. Finally read a tutorial on Diffusion models. Now, I understand how they work just not why they work. To me it\u0026#39;s crazy that they do. pic.twitter.com/LXm5OrD993\n\u0026mdash; Varun Tulsian (@varuntul22) October 5, 2022 Diffusion Models Series In this series, I will attempt to simplify the concepts and provide you with some code that you can easily run on Google Colab or your local Jupyter server. To be able to run things with minimal setup, we will be working on a 2D dataset (generated using scikit-learn) and the EMNIST dataset (28x28x1 images).\nThis is the first of 3 posts on diffusion models. You can check all the posts in the Full Diffusion Model Series. All the code for the diffusion model series is available here.\nThe first 2 parts of the series will focus on setting up the basic concepts and code. You won\u0026rsquo;t need a GPU to run the notebooks. The code is written in PyTorch. We will be working on simple 2D distributions and trying to generate them using denoising:\nPart 1: I will introduce the basics of the denoising approach for the diffusion model. We will predict the original distribution directly, following the first part of Luo, 20221\nPart 2: I will introduce some optimizations that have been shown to work better. The 2^nd^ part will include classifier-free guidance and steps to generate distributions faster using striding. This will correspond to the second part (Three Equivalent Interpretations) of Luo, 20221 In the last part of the series, we will be using the concepts learned to implement diffusion models for character generation. This will be done by training a U-Net model over the Extended-MNIST dataset. The code is written in JAX, Haiku.\nThere are a few high-quality blogs that can help you understand diffusion models in greater depth. A comprehensive list of resources can be found here.\nWhat are Diffusion Models? Let\u0026rsquo;s go over this again, this time in a little more detail. We will start seeing some mathematical equations and PyTorch code below.\nFigure 5: Graphical representation of a Denoising Diffusion Model. The decoder is the $p$ function, the encoder is the $q$ function. (Image source: Calvin Luo; 2022)\nDenoising Diffusion models are a Markovian Hierarchical Variational Auto Encoder , unlike a standard VAE model the encoder process (diffusion) and the decoder process (denoising) occur in multiple steps. Figure 5 depicts the diffusion process, which begins with a random variable $x$ and generates random variables $x_t$ at the $t^{th}$ step. The denoising process starts at $x_T$ and attempts to generate $\\hat x_t$ and ultimately $\\hat x_0$.\nWe will be going over the Diffusion Process and the Denoising Process followed by the Training procedure. But first, let\u0026rsquo;s build an understanding of what needs to be done to implement such a model.\nTraining a Denoising Diffusion model\nThis is the main source of confusion when it comes to understanding diffusion models. From the description above and the analogy with the VAEs it would seem that training a diffusion model would consist of the following steps.\nUsing some data as an input ($x_0$). Perform a Forward Pass (Diffusion), generating $x_t$\u0026rsquo;s in order. Run the noisy image ($x_T$) to the Backward pass (Denoising) to get $\\hat x_0$. This would be done using a $NN(\\hat x_t, t)$ and the output should be $\\hat x_{t-1}$. Performing a weight update of the model $NN$ after computing a loss-based $L(x_t, \\hat x_t)$. However, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the case ðŸ™ˆ. Let\u0026rsquo;s investigate the issues with this approach. For every input in our dataset, we will have to go through all the timesteps, apply diffusion, and then go through the whole denoising steps, with weight updates only happening at the end of the pass. Training in such a way would be slow, and we would not be able to meaningfully learn anything useful.\nInstead, we can show that we can effectively learn the distribution $p(X)$ while just doing the following steps.\nusing some data as an input ($x_0$). 1a. Take uniform and random samples of a time variable $t$ ranging from $1,to,T$. Compute the latent variable $x_t$ in a single step. Refer to the diffusion process section. Apply the $NN$ model to the noisy image ($x_t$) to obtain $\\hat x_t0$. The result of $NN(\\hat x_t, t)$ is $\\hat x_t0$. We will not go over each step during training. Note about notation: $\\hat x_t0$ is the predicted reconstruction of the input $x_0$ at timestep $t$.\nPerforming a weight update of the model $NN$ after computing a loss-based $L(x, \\hat x_t0, t)$. Pseudo code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 def diffusion(x_0, t): code to add noise to x_0 return x_i def training(): for loop until convergence: pick an image x_0 from X (batch of images) sample t from 1 to T x_t = diffusion(x_0, t) x_hat_t = NN(x_t, t) loss_ = loss(x_0, x_hat_t) update(NN, grad(loss_) # denoising def generate_new_data(): sample x_T from N(0, I) for t in range(T, 1): x_hat_t = NN(x_t, t) # get x_{t-1} x_{t-1} = func(x_hat_t, t) x_hat_0 = x_0 The proof requires us to reduce the ELBO loss making use of the Markovian assumption in the diffusion process, and using Monte-Carlo estimates to obtain an equivalent loss. I won\u0026rsquo;t go into details on this proof, please refer Section: Variational Diffusion Models, equation 100 gives the reduced loss 1.\nDiffusion Process As described earlier, we are going to be adding noise to the input vector. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how exactly one can do that \u0026ndash;\nAt each timestep $t$ in the diffusion process, we sample from the latent variable, $q_t(x_t|x_{t-1})$. $$ q_t(x_t|x_{t-1}) = N(\\sqrt\\alpha_tx_{t-1}, (1 - \\alpha_t )I) $$ $\\alpha_t$, $t\\in[1, T]$, where $\\alpha_t \u0026lt; 1$, describes the diffusion schedule. $\\alpha_{t-1} \u0026lt; \\alpha_t$, as we go along in the diffusion process we are adding more and more noise.\nThe form of the coefficients is chosen such that the variance of the latent variables stay at a similar scale. At this point, let me introduce the reparameterization trick.\n$$ N(\\sqrt\\alpha_tx_{t-1}, (1 - \\alpha_t )I) = \\sqrt\\alpha_tx_{t-1} + (1 - \\alpha_t)*\\epsilon \\quad with \\,\\, \\epsilon \\sim N(0, I) $$ The reparemetarization trick is cool, it simplifies working with a complex Gaussian distribution. If you want to sample from the diffusion step at $t$, you can simply sample from a standard Gaussian distribution $N(0, I)$ and factor and plug in the mean and variance. Consider another interesting result: suppose we want to sample from the latent $x_t$ directly given $x_0$. In other words, we want to take a sample from $q(x_t|x_0)$.\n$$ \\begin{align} q(x_t|x) \u0026= N(\\sqrt\\alpha_tx_{t-1}, (1 - \\alpha_t )I) \\cr \u0026= \\sqrt\\alpha_t x_{t-1} + \\sqrt{(1-\\alpha_t)}\\ast\\epsilon_t \\cr \u0026= \\sqrt\\alpha_t(\\sqrt\\alpha_t x_{t-2} + \\sqrt{(1-\\alpha_{t-1})}\\ast\\epsilon_{t-1}) + \\sqrt(1-\\alpha_t)\\ast\\epsilon_t \\cr \u0026= \\sqrt\\alpha_t\\sqrt\\alpha_t x_{t-2} + \\sqrt\\alpha_t\\sqrt{(1-\\alpha_{t-1})}\\ast\\epsilon_{t-1} + \\sqrt(1-\\alpha_t)\\ast\\epsilon_t \\cr \u0026= \\sqrt\\alpha_t\\sqrt\\alpha_tx_{t-2} + \\sqrt{(1-\\alpha_t\\alpha_{t-1})}\\ast\\epsilon_{t-1}^\\ast \\quad where \\thinspace \\epsilon_{t-1}^\\ast\\in N(0, I) \\cr \u0026= ... \\cr \u0026= \\sqrt{\\bar\\alpha_t}x_0 + \\sqrt{(1 - \\bar\\alpha_t )}\\ast\\epsilon^\\ast ; where \\space \\bar\\alpha_t=\\Pi_{i=1}^T{\\sqrt\\alpha_i}, \\space \\epsilon^\\ast \\in N(0, I) \\cr \u0026= N(\\sqrt{\\bar\\alpha_t}x_0, (1 - \\bar\\alpha_t )I)\\cr \\end{align} $$ In equation 5, we have utilized sum of two independent Gaussian random variables.\nWith this in place, let\u0026rsquo;s put some code together.\nThe diffusion schedule: $\\alpha$\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 timestepts = 200 ## linear schedule def linear_beta_schedule(timesteps): beta_start = 0.0001 beta_end = 0.02 return jnp.linspace(beta_start, beta_end, timesteps) ## cosine schedule as proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09672 ## The cosine schedule is recommened if timesteps \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 200.

Let\u0026rsquo;s define the loss function and the Neural Network.\nNeural Network:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 from torch import nn class DenoisingModelSequential(nn.Module): def __init__(self, hidden_units=32): super(DenoisingModelSequential, self).__init__() # hidden_units = 32 self.mlp = nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(3, int(hidden_units), bias=True), nn.GELU(), nn.Linear(int(hidden_units), int(hidden_units/2), bias=True), nn.GELU(), nn.Linear(int(hidden_units/2), int(hidden_units/4), bias=True), nn.GELU(), nn.Linear(int(hidden_units/4), int(hidden_units/8), bias=True), nn.GELU(), nn.Linear(int(hidden_units/8), int(hidden_units/16), bias=True), nn.GELU(), nn.Linear(int(hidden_units/16), int(hidden_units/8), bias=True), nn.GELU(), nn.Linear(int(hidden_units/8), int(hidden_units/4), bias=True), nn.GELU(), nn.Linear(int(hidden_units/4), int(hidden_units/2), bias=True), nn.GELU(), nn.Linear(int(hidden_units/2), int(hidden_units), bias=True), nn.GELU(), nn.Linear(int(hidden_units), 2, bias=True) ) def forward(self, x): x = self.mlp(x) return x denoising_model = DenoisingModelSequential(64) The input to the NN is 3 dimensional. We are working with 2d dataset, so $\\hat x_t$\u0026rsquo;s is a 2d vector. In this article, we are going to pass $t$ as the 3rd dimension, we will pass it as a scalar. In the subsequent articles, we will see how to generate an embedding for a timestep and concatenate/fuse it with the input. The output of the NN needs to be $\\hat x_t^0$ which is a 2d vector. The NN architecture doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter. In this case, I\u0026rsquo;ve used a basic Multi Layer Perceptron with GeLU activation units3. We will use a U-net architecture for character generation using the EMNIST dataset. Checkout Part 4.\nLoss Function: At timestep $t$ $$ Loss(x_0, \\hat x_t, t) = 1/2\\ast(\\frac{\\bar\\alpha_{t-1}}{1-\\bar\\alpha_{t-1}} - \\frac{\\bar\\alpha_t}{1-\\bar\\alpha_t})\\ast\\mid\\mid x_0-\\hat x_0^t\\mid\\mid_2^2 $$ $$ \\text{SNR}_t =\\frac{\\bar\\alpha_t}{1-\\bar\\alpha_t} $$ SNR stands for Signal to Noise. In the case of the diffusion, the schedule must to be chosen such that $SNR_t \u0026lt; SNT_{t-1}$.\nLoss:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 # instead of the l2 loss, I use the huber loss # https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.HuberLoss.html loss_func = nn.HuberLoss() imp_weight = torch.sqrt(1/2 * ((alphas_prev_[timestep] / (1 - alphas_prev_[timestep])) - (alphas_[timestep]/(1 - alphas_[timestep])))) loss_ = loss_func(data_in_batch.mul(imp_weight), pred_data.T.mul(imp_weight)) In Variation Diffusion Models2, authors propose using a separate Neural Network to model SNR as a function of t. The Neural Network should be monotonically decreasing.\nDenoising Process Let\u0026rsquo;s recap, the denoising process is responsible to generate synthetic data $\\hat x$.\nStart with a completely noisy data, $x_T = N(0, I)$ Uses a Neural Network to predict $\\hat x_T^0$ We will use $\\hat x_T^0$ to generate the latent $\\hat x_{T-1}$ repeat step 2 with input $\\hat x_{T-1}$ to get $\\hat x_{T-2}$ until t=1 Refer, our mathematical setup in Figure 5. Let\u0026rsquo;s try to look at a backward transition in the denoising process $p(\\hat x_t|\\hat x_{t+1})$. This is also called the posterior distribution.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s investigate what this looks like in the diffusion process: $$ \\begin{align} q(x_t|x_{t+1}) = \\frac{q(x_t|x_{t-1})\\ast q(x_{t-1}|x_0)}{q(x_t|x_0)}\\quad \\text{Baye's theorem \\\u0026} \\, \\text{Note: } x_0 = x \\cr = ... \\cr \\varpropto N(x_{t-1};\\underbrace{\\frac{\\sqrt\\alpha_t(1-\\bar\\alpha_{t-1})x_t + \\sqrt{\\bar\\alpha_{t-1}}(1-\\alpha_t)x_0}{1-\\bar\\alpha_t}}_{\\mu_q(x_t,x_0)}, \\underbrace{\\frac{(1-\\alpha_t)(1-\\bar\\alpha_{t-1})}{1-\\bar\\alpha_t}I}_{\\sum_q(t)}) \\cr \\end{align} $$ For the full derivation please refer Equation #71; Calvin Luo\u0026rsquo;s tutorial1\nWe will assume that the reverse process $p(\\hat x_t|\\hat x_{t+1})$ also follows the same form as the forward process $q(x_t|x_{t+1})$. We will hence do the following \u0026ndash;\nAssume that posterior $p(\\hat x_t|\\hat x_{t+1})$ follows a Gaussian distribution as well. We would keep the posterior mean follow the same form as $\\mu_q(x_t, x_0)$. $\\mu_p(\\hat x_t|\\hat x_{t+1}) = \\mu_q(x_t, x_0)$, here $\\hat x_t$ is the input to the $NN$ and the $NN$ will output a prediction for $\\hat x_t^0$ In Equation 11, we will replace $x_0$ with $\\hat x_t^0$ and $x_t$ with $\\hat x_t$ With fixed variance, $\\sum_{p(x_{t-1}|x_t)} = \\sum_q(t)$. As show in Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models.4 We could alternatively learn the posterior variance. In this case, we will make the neural network output the variance as well as the mean.
